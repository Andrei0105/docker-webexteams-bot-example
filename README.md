# DockerSparkBotExample
This should get you started with a Cisco Spark Bot very quickly.

### Getting started
You need a machine with Docker. Both Linux and window are supported and should just work for Mac as well.


```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/haskalpa/docker-spark-bot-example.git
./build.sh 
./run_hello_bot.sh 
```
